            Welcome to my first pleasant-looking webpage!

            <p>I have to thank The Odin Project for providing the colour pallete and the structure.
               I don't think I would manage to build a webpage without their help.

        “If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, 
        by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”
